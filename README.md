# HelloTwitch

HelloTwitch is a script for the Streamlabs Chatbot. It watches the chat and plots a list of viewers that wrote something.
This makes it easier to greet your viewer. You can optionally specify phrases that need to be used in order to be recognized as greeting.

In the settings you will also find a button to open the list as an html page that will connect to Streamlabs Chatbot and retrieve the list. (Otherwise you wouldn't be able to see it.)
